In the beginning, there was the cube. We know not where it comes from
only that it holds the power, to create worlds and fill them with lives. 
That is how our race was born, and for a time we lived in harmony but like
for all great power, some wwanted it for good others for evil. And so began the war; a
war that ravaged our planet, until it was consumed by death. And the cube was lost to the far
reaches of space. We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home. Searching
every star, every world. And just when all hope seemed lost. Message of a new discovery, drew us to an unknown planet
called Earth. But we were already too late.
