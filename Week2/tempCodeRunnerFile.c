  Write a program where you can enter an integer n from the keyboard. Then a conversion table for
    1 to n days should be printed on the screen as in the example below. Make sure that the integer
    value you entered for n is valid (positive and non-zero). If an invalid integer n was entered then
    repeat the entering until a valid value will be entered.
    Use a while loop in your solution.
    1 day = 24 hours
    2 days = 48 hours
    3 days = 72 hours
