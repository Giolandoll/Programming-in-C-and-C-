1)When you comment out "using namespace std", several errors are generated due 
to elements in the code that require a prefix to avoid ambiguous instances. 
These elements include cin and cout and string which all exists in the standard
library. Using the line "using namespace std" helps to avoid this problem. 

To fix this without using that line, adding std:: before each instance of the 
elements cin, cout and string will declare that those elements are apart of the
standard library. 


2)By removing Critter:: prefix in one of the methods, a undefined identifier error
is generated. This is because the definition of the method is changed making it no
longger a defined member of the Critter class. Hence it can no longer access the class
members of Critter.
